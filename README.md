# TwitterBot
Bot that replies to any/all tweets with a given (specified) hashtag and reply 

The user enters a hashtag and a reply message (optional -  if ommitted, it defaults to #Spurs, and #Hi, <user name>, Spurs
  are the best team in the world :), and including the hash symbol in the hashtag is optional), and the bot streams through all tweets with that hashtag and replies to them (until it gets suspended for too much activity).
